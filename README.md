# whitelister.sh

whitelister.sh is a (mostly) POSIX compliant BASH Shell Script that can be used to internally whitelist 3rd party IP addresses by making entries into one or more types of access control list (ACL) files. This version of the script is specifically tailored for use by members of SAP ICC's RAC team, to whitelist the IP addresses of SAP's partners by making appropriate entried into the "webdisptab" and "saprouttab" files.

Documentation on how to use / maintain the script can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/SAP-ICC/whitelister.sh/wiki/)
